    """'ViennaCL' C++ Header Files.

    'ViennaCL' is a free open-source linear algebra library for computations on
    many-core architectures (GPUs, MIC) and multi-core CPUs. The library is
    written in C++ and supports 'CUDA', 'OpenCL', and 'OpenMP' (including
    switches at runtime). I have placed these libraries in this package as a
    more efficient distribution system for CRAN. The idea is that you can write
    a package that depends on the 'ViennaCL' library and yet you do not need to
    distribute a copy of this code with your package."""
